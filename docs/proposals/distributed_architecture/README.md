## Executive Summary

Microscaler proposes comprehensive enhancements to Flintlock, significantly advancing distributed management capabilities, operational resilience, and scalability. Key benefits include improved reliability, reduced downtime, enhanced security, and simplified operational practices. Microscaler seeks active collaboration from the Liquid Metal governance board and the broader community to realise these improvements promptly and effectively.

---

## Motivation and Background

Flintlock currently faces scalability, robustness, and operational clarity limitations that hinder effective deployment at scale. Real-world scenarios, such as managing large-scale distributed deployments and recovering from critical host failures, underscore the importance of these enhancements. Addressing these areas ensures Flintlock can effectively support complex, real-world operational needs.

## Microscaler's Requirements and Objectives

Microscaler seeks these enhancements to efficiently manage distributed workloads at scale, minimise operational risks, enhance system resilience, and reduce administrative overhead. Clear objectives include reduced downtime, improved resource utilisation, and robust recovery mechanisms, benefiting both Microscaler and the broader community.

| Enhancement                                        | Description | Link |
|----------------------------------------------------| --- | --- |
| Raft Consensus Integration                         | Integrate Raft for distributed consensus and reliability, ensuring consistent state replication and leader election across nodes. | [Details](./docs/01-Raft_Consensus_Integration.md) |
| Distributed Scheduling and Bidding Mechanism       | Enable distributed workload scheduling and resource bidding, allowing dynamic allocation of resources based on demand and availability. | [Details](./docs/02-Distributed_Scheduling_and_Bidding_Mechanism.md) |
| Unified API Interface and Proxy Routing            | Provide a unified API and proxy routing for seamless operations, simplifying client interactions and enabling transparent request forwarding. | [Details](./docs/03-Unified_API_Interface_and_Proxy_Routing.md) |
| Host Failure Handling                              | Improve detection and recovery from host failures, including automated failover and state reconciliation to minimize service disruption. | [Details](./docs/04-Host_Failure_Handling.md) |
| Detached Host Garbage Collection                   | Automate cleanup of detached or orphaned hosts, reclaiming resources and maintaining cluster hygiene without manual intervention. | [Details](./docs/05-Detached_Host_Garbage_Collection.md) |
| Host Regenesis and PXE-Based Provisioning          | Support host re-provisioning using PXE, enabling rapid recovery and scaling by automating bare-metal host setup and configuration. | [Details](./docs/06-Host_Regenesis_and_PXE_Provisioning.md) |
| VM Regeneration, Persistence and Recovery          | Ensure VM state can be persisted and recovered, allowing restoration of workloads after failures or migrations with minimal data loss. | [Details](./docs/07-VM_State_Persistence_and_Recovery.md) |
| Network Partition Handling & Split-Brain Scenarios | Address network partitions and split-brain issues, implementing safeguards to maintain data consistency and prevent conflicting operations. | [Details](./docs/08-Network_Partition_Handling_and_Split-Brain_Scenarios.md) |
| Leader Scheduling Bottleneck                       | Mitigate leader scheduling bottlenecks by distributing scheduling responsibilities and optimizing leader election processes for scalability. | [Details](./docs/09-Leader_Scheduling_Bottleneck.md) |
| Host Rejoining and State Reconciliation            | Enable hosts to rejoin and reconcile state, ensuring that returning nodes synchronize with the cluster and recover their workloads safely. | [Details](./docs/10-Host_Rejoining_and_State_Reconciliation.md) |
| Raft Log Scalability and Snapshotting              | Improve Raft log scalability and add snapshotting, reducing storage overhead and speeding up recovery by periodically compacting logs. | [Details](./docs/11-Raft_Log_Scalability_and_Snapshotting.md) |
| Security and Authorization                         | Enhance security and authorization mechanisms, introducing fine-grained access controls and robust authentication for all operations. | [Details](./docs/12-Security_and_Authorization.md) |
| Garbage Collection Policy                          | Define and enforce garbage collection policies, specifying criteria and schedules for resource cleanup to optimize system performance. | [Details](./docs/13-Garbage_Collection_Policy.md) |
| Observability, Metrics, and Tracing                | Add observability, metrics, and tracing support, enabling real-time monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance analysis of distributed components. | [Details](./docs/14-Observability_Metrics_and_Tracing.md) |
| Graceful VM Migration Support                      | Support graceful migration of VMs, allowing live or planned movement of workloads between hosts with minimal downtime and service impact. | [Details](./docs/15-Graceful_VM_Migration_Support.md) |
| Configuration and Operational Clarity              | Improve configuration and operational transparency, providing clear documentation, validation, and tooling for easier management and troubleshooting. | [Details](./docs/16-Configuration_and_Operational_Clarity.md) |
