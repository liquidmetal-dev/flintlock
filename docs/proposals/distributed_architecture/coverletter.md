Dear Members of the Liquid Metal Governance Board,

I am pleased to submit this Enhancement Proposal on behalf of Microscaler for your consideration. 
At Microscaler, we are committed to advancing open-source technologies that empower scalable and robust 
distributed infrastructure. 
As the lead engineer for the Tinkerbell Project and founder of Microscaler, I firmly believe in 
collaborative innovation that delivers substantial and lasting benefits to our community.

The attached proposal outlines critical enhancements to Flintlock, focusing on comprehensive improvements 
to distributed management, operational resilience, and scalability. If implemented successfully, these 
enhancements position Flintlock as a leading system in distributed infrastructure management, significantly 
ahead of contemporary solutions in robustness, operational clarity, and community-driven innovation.

In preparing this proposal, we consciously chose not to fork Flintlock or fragment its potential user base. 

Instead, we decided to collaborate with the existing community actively, enhancing Flintlockâ€™s capabilities to 
create a more compelling, unified solution. This collaborative approach not only preserves but actively 
grows Flintlock's user base, fostering broader adoption and deeper community engagement.

We have structured the proposal with an inclusive vision, inviting collaboration and contribution from the 
broader community. This strategic partnership will ensure the enhancements meet diverse operational 
requirements while maintaining alignment with our shared goals.

Your support and leadership will be instrumental in realising the full potential of Flintlock. Together, we 
can set new standards in operational excellence and community collaboration, establishing Flintlock 
as the benchmark in its domain.

Thank you for considering this forward-thinking proposal. I look forward to your feedback and to 
continued collaboration 
that advances our collective vision.

Sincerely,

Charles Sibbald
Founder, Microscaler (Tinkerbell Project)
