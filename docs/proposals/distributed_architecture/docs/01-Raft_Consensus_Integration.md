## Raft Consensus Integration

### Gap Definition and Improvement Objectives

Currently, Flintlock operates with isolated state per host, lacking a unified, cluster-wide coordination mechanism. Integrating Raft consensus addresses this gap by ensuring reliable leader election, consistent log replication, and synchronized state management across the cluster.

**Objectives:**

* Reliable leader election to ensure continuity
* Consistent log replication across hosts
* Robust global state synchronization for VM management

### Technical Implementation and Detailed Architecture

* **Raft Library:** Leverage a well-established Raft implementation such as HashiCorp Raft or etcd Raft.
* **Leader Election:** Implement leader election protocols ensuring rapid detection of failures and quick election of a new leader.
* **Log Replication:** Define structured logs capturing critical VM lifecycle events (creation, updates, deletion).
* **Cluster-wide State Machine:** Develop a state machine that consistently applies VM lifecycle operations from replicated logs.

### Trade-offs and Risks

* **Complexity:** Increased system complexity balanced by significant reliability improvements.
* **Performance Overhead:** Slight overhead from log replication and consensus coordination, which must be monitored and optimized.

### Operational Impacts and User Considerations

* **Transparency:** The integration should remain transparent to end-users, requiring no changes in current workflows.
* **Reliability:** Improved operational reliability and simplified management for system operators.

### Validation and Testing Strategies

* **Leader Election Tests:** Comprehensive tests to validate rapid leader election and failover.
* **Log Replication Tests:** Validate accuracy and performance of log replication across nodes.
* **State Consistency Tests:** Continuously ensure the cluster maintains a consistent view of the global state.

### Visualizations and Diagrams

* **High-Level Design (HLD) Diagram:** Clearly illustrates the integration of Raft within Flintlock.
* **Sequence Diagram:** Demonstrates the leader election, log replication, and state synchronization processes clearly.

### Summary for Enhancement Proposal

Integrating Raft consensus into Flintlock significantly enhances cluster reliability, consistency, and operational resilience. This structured approach ensures minimal operational overhead while providing robust coordination capabilities, preparing Flintlock for highly available, distributed deployments.
