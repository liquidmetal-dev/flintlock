## What is flintlock?

Flintlock is a service for creating and managing the lifecycle of microVMs on a host machine. Initially we will be supporting [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/).

The primary use case for flintlock is to create microVMs on a bare-metal host where the microVMs will be used as nodes in a virtualized Kubernetes cluster. It is an essential part of [Liquid Metal](https://www.weave.works/blog/multi-cluster-kubernetes-on-microvms-for-bare-metal) and will ultimately be driven by Cluster API Provider Microvm (coming soon).

## Features

Using API requests (via gRPC or HTTP):

- Create and delete microVMs using Firecracker
- Manage the lifecycle of microVMs (i.e. start, stop, pause)
- Configure microVM metadata via cloud-init, ignition etc
- Use OCI images for microVM volumes, kernel and initrd
- (coming soon) Use CNI to configure the network for the microVMs
