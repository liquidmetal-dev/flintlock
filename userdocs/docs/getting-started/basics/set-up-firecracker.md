# Set up Firecracker

We have to use a custom built firecracker from the macvtap branch
([see][discussion-107]).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker.git
git fetch origin feature/macvtap
git checkout -b feature/macvtap origin/feature/macvtap
# This will build it in a docker container, no rust installation required.
tools/devtool build

# Any directories on $PATH.
TARGET=~/local/bin
toolbox=$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl

cp build/cargo_target/${toolbox}/debug/{firecracker,jailer} ${TARGET}
```

If you don't have to compile it yourself, you can download a pre-built version
from the [Pre-requisities discussion][discussion-107].
